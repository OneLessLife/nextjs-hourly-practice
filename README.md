# Daily Next.js Contributions 🚀

This repository is a **Next.js project** created with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and is used for **daily development contributions**.

The goal of this repo is simple:
- ✅ Practice Next.js regularly  
- ✅ Make at least one meaningful update every day  
- ✅ Maintain consistent GitHub contributions  
- ✅ Improve frontend skills through small, incremental changes

## 📅 Daily Contribution Philosophy

Each day may include:
- UI or layout improvements
- Component refactoring
- Small feature additions
- Performance or accessibility tweaks
- Code cleanup or documentation updates

Even small changes matter — consistency over size.
